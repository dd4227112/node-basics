1. Node help us to excute javscript code outside of the browser
2. _ is the special variable that hold the value of the previous express 
3. We use require('module_name') function to import module in node js
4. readline is the module used to read user input from nodejs terminal. It return an object
5. fs is the module used to read and write file in nodejs. It return an object
6. Read about Javascript premises
7. We use http module to create a web server, use http module which return an object
8. In nodejs we can not use static file directly(i.e icluding css, js files)
9. Json data must be converted into Javascript object using JSON.parse(json_data) function
10. We use url module to take the full url including query string by setting true in parse method.It return an object
11. We can create a custom event by importing event module from node. Event module gives custom event emitter.
12. stream help us to read/ write/ request files/data in chucks.
13. Run npm init to create initial configuration details of application. It create  a json file named package.json
14. We install regural dependencies package by running npm install package_name ( optionally we can specify version we want by using @, ie package_name@5.1 otherwise latest version wil be installed). packages are stored in node_modules folders ( These are regural dependencies and are required for working of our application)
15. we install development  dependencies package ( required for fasten development only) by running npm install package_name --save-dev ( We add this  --save-dev to mean that it the development dependencies)
16. Nodemon is the development package that used to restart the development automatically each time we make changes in our node application. Install it globally since can be used for all node applications ( add -g to install gloabll).ie npm install -g nodemon --save-dev or run shortcut npm i -g nodemon --save-dev
17. Main dependencies for nodejs application are Google V8 Engine and LIBUV
18. Google V8 Engine (responsible for excuting javscript code and translating javascript code to machine language that computer can read and understand)
19. LIBUV (Give  nodejs ability to access computer resources like files, OS, networking et. It implement two mai features of node (Event Loop and Thread Pool) )
20. When creating API with nodejs express, We need to use middleware to attach the body request in request.body
21. We use use() function to apply express middleware in any route.
22. a middleware should contain three parameters (request, response, next())
23. morgan package is the third part middleware that help to log the information about the request on the console. It help in development process (npm install morgan)
24. We use static middleware to serve the static file in express application (static files:html, css, js, image, xls, words etc)
25. To set the nodejs environment, we run this is terminal set VARIABLE_NAME = variable_value
26. We use dotenv package to tell node abaout our environment variables and be able to identify them in node process (npm install dotenv)
27. MongoDB datatypr:string, boolean, NumberInt, NumberLong, NumberDecimal, ObjectId ( The same as uuid generated automatically by MongoDB), Date=>(ISODate, Timestamp), Embedde Documents(.ie Products:{...}), Arrays
28. A document can have maxmum of 60MB. Each document have maxmum 100 embedded document(nested documents)
